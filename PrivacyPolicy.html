        <h1>Privacy Policy for SecSMS Android App</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 08-02-2026</p>

        <p>
            Mr. Kanti Arumilli, Founder of ALight Technology And Services Limited and ALight Technologies USA Inc. ("we", "us", or "our") developed the SecSMS Android application
            (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, and protects
            information when you use it on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                The App does not collect any personal information from you. Does not even ask for Internet permissions.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with
            this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information App Collects</h2>

        <p>
            The App does not require you to create an account and does not connect to our own
            remote servers. All processing is performed locally on your device, except when you
            explicitly send data via Bluetooth to your own paired desktop device.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 SMS Messages (including OTP codes)</h3>
        <p>
            With your permission, the App accesses recent SMS messages stored on your device in order to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read incoming SMS content.</li>
            <li>Detect and extract one-time passwords (OTPs) and similar verification codes.</li>
            <li>Display detected codes and allow you to select which one to use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The App does not transmit your SMS content to our servers or to third-party services.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Device and Phone State Information</h3>
        <p>
            The App may request access to phone state information (for example, SIM slot
            information) in order to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine from which SIM slot an SMS was received.</li>
            <li>Improve how message details are displayed to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The App does not use this information to track you or to identify you personally
            outside of your device.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Bluetooth Information</h3>
        <p>
            When you explicitly choose to send an OTP to a desktop application, the App:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses Bluetooth to discover and connect to a device that you select.</li>
            <li>Exchanges cryptographic keys and transmits the selected OTP over that
                Bluetooth connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The App does not search for or connect to devices without your explicit action.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How App Uses Your Information</h2>

        <p>App uses the information described above solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read SMS messages on your device in order to detect OTPs and similar verification codes.</li>
            <li>Present multiple detected codes so you can choose the correct one.</li>
            <li>Display SMS details (sender, time, SIM slot, masked message content) inside the App.</li>
            <li>Send the selected OTP to your desktop application via Bluetooth using RSA encryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not use your SMS content for advertising, analytics, or profiling purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>SMS messages are stored by your mobile operating system and carrier, not by us.</li>
            <li>The App reads SMS content as needed and may store temporary data in memory while you
                use the App.</li>
            <li>The App does not create its own long-term cloud backup of your SMS messages.</li>
            <li>When you uninstall the App, any App-specific data stored locally on your device is
                removed, subject to the standard behavior of the Android operating system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>

        <p>We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect or Sell your personal information.</li>
            <li>Share your SMS content or OTPs with advertising networks or analytics providers.</li>
            <li>Transfer your data to our own servers or to external third-party servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The only data transfer supported by the App is between your phone and your own desktop
            device, via Bluetooth, when you explicitly choose to send an OTP. This transfer is
            encrypted using RSA.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Permissions Used by the App</h2>

        <p>The App may request the following Android permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>READ_SMS</strong> &mdash; used to read SMS messages on your device so the App can
                detect OTPs and display message details.</li>
            <li><strong>READ_PHONE_STATE</strong> &mdash; used to obtain information such as SIM slot to
                help present message details correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>BLUETOOTH / BLUETOOTH_ADMIN / BLUETOOTH_CONNECT / BLUETOOTH_SCAN</strong>
                &mdash; used to discover, pair, and connect to your chosen desktop device and to
                transmit encrypted OTPs between your phone and that device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are used only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>

        <p>
            We take reasonable technical measures to protect the information processed by the App,
            including using RSA encryption to protect OTPs transmitted over Bluetooth between your
            phone and your desktop device and limiting data collection to what is necessary for the
            App's core functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. You use the App at
            your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>
            The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect
            personal information from any person. If you believe a child has provided us with
            personal information through or because of the App, please contact us so that we can take appropriate
            action.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the
            "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically to stay informed about how the App handles your information.
        </p>
